    //Static variables
//
// When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created
// and shared by all objects at class level. Static variables are also called class variables.
// All instances i.e. objects of the class share the same static variable.
//
//We can create static variables at class-level only.
// Infact, both the static and non-static variables are declared at the class level.
//static: class member, can be called through the class as it is associated with the class name
//there is only one copy of the static variable, shared by all objects
//
//            prefers to be called through class name
//
//            static ONLY accepts static - No direct entry of instance member inside static
//
//
//    static members:
//            1. static variable (class variables)
//            2. static methods
//            3. static initializer block OR static block OR static initialization block
//            4. static nested class
//

        //static variable: declared outside any method block with static keyword.
//there is only one copy of static variable , shared by all objects

    int i=25; // instance
    int n=10; //instance
    static int s=100;//static variable: declared outside any method block with the static keyword.

    //init block
    { System.out.println("Namaste"); }
    //static block
    static { System.out.println("Hi"); }

    }

    static int j = 20;

    //a static block OR static initializer OR static initialization block
    static{ System.out.println("Hello");  }
